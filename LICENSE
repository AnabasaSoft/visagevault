GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the
GNU General Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a
mode of using an interface.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library. The various terms of the GNU GPL
concerning "modified versions" and "derivative works" apply to
the Combined Work, mutatis mutandis, as to works covered by
the GNU GPL.

When a section of a file does not relate to the Library, and is an
independent work in itself, whose distribution is not conditioned by
being linked with the Library, that section is not covered by this
License. Otherwise, the object code for that section is a Combined
Work.

"Minimum Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Library, including any data and utility
programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from it, but
excluding the source code, build scripts and installation utilities
for the Application.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means the
source code for all the work and all the data and utility programs
needed for generating, installing, and running the object code and to
modify the work and reproduce its object code form, all subject to
the condition that the Modified Source Code includes the work's
Corresponding Source and a complete installation script that will
install the work and its Corresponding Source, so that the object
code form is not considered an "Associated Data".

1. Exception to the GNU General Public License.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, must not restrict or forbid the user of the Combined
Work from modifying the Library or its use for debugging. You may
convey a copy of the Combined Work under terms of your choice,
provided that those terms, taken together, do not forbid the user of
the Combined Work from:

a) Modifying the Library and running the modified version for
their own purposes (using the Modified Source Code);

b) Running the Combined Work under the terms of the GNU GPL;

c) Receiving the Corresponding Source for the Library in a form
suitable for installing and executing the modified version in
a copy of the Combined Work.

The "Corresponding Source" for the Combined Work must be included,
in a form suitable for installing and running the modified version
in a copy of the Combined Work, with the object code form.

2. Exceptions to the GNU General Public License.

a) When a section of a file does not relate to the Library, and is an
independent work in itself, whose distribution is not conditioned by
being linked with the Library, that section is not covered by this
License. Otherwise, the object code for that section is a Combined
Work.

b) The various terms of the GNU GPL concerning "modified versions" and
"derivative works" apply to the Combined Work, mutatis mutandis, as
to works covered by the GNU GPL.

c) If the Combined Work is distributed under terms that are compatible
with the GNU GPL, the Combined Work may be distributed under those
terms.

d) If the Combined Work is distributed under terms that are
incompatible with the GNU GPL, the Combined Work may be distributed
under those terms, provided that those terms, taken together, do not
forbid the user of the Combined Work from:

i) Modifying the Library and running the modified version for their
own purposes (using the Modified Source Code);

ii) Running the Combined Work under the terms of the GNU GPL;

iii) Receiving the Corresponding Source for the Library in a form
suitable for installing and executing the modified version in
a copy of the Combined Work.

e) You may convey a copy of the Combined Work under terms of your
choice, provided that those terms, taken together, do not forbid
the user of the Combined Work from:

i) Modifying the Library and running the modified version for their
own purposes (using the Modified Source Code);

ii) Running the Combined Work under the terms of the GNU GPL;

iii) Receiving the Corresponding Source for the Library in a form
suitable for installing and executing the modified version in
a copy of the Combined Work.

f) You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, must not restrict or forbid the user of the Combined
Work from modifying the Library or its use for debugging. You may
convey a copy of the Combined Work under terms of your choice,
provided that those terms, taken together, do not forbid the user of
the Combined Work from:

i) Modifying the Library and running the modified version for their
own purposes (using the Modified Source Code);

ii) Running the Combined Work under the terms of the GNU GPL;

iii) Receiving the Corresponding Source for the Library in a form
suitable for installing and executing the modified version in
a copy of the Combined Work.

3. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you convey a copy of the Library, or a Modified Version of it,
under this License, you must also convey the Library, or Modified
Version, under the terms of this License.

4. Conveying Applications.

You may convey an Application under terms of your choice, provided
that the Application is otherwise an independent work in itself, and
that the distribution of the Application is not conditioned on being
linked with the Library.

5. Other Rules.

The other rules of the GNU GPL version 3 apply to this License.
